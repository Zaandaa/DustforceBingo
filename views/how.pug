	p All 64 Nexus levels are the goals, and lockout is always on. Beat or SS levels first to establish your board area.
	p If capturing is on, goals can be captured by surrounding all borders (diagonals don't count). Capture multiple goals by surrounding all borders of that group.
	p Goals that border walls cannot be captured. Therefore, your area is permanently safe if it connects to a wall.
